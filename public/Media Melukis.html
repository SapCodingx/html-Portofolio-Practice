<h1>THE BEST ART MEDIUMS ACCORDING TO SAPNAH</h1>
<h2>My top 3 mediums.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Watercolors</h3>
<p>I love the transparencies of watercolor and how I can control the water.</p>

<h3>Pencil</h3>
<p>Pencis are slow medium but I enjoy using them and I can make fine details. Both pencil and colored pencils are my favorite.</p>

<h3>Gouache</h3>
<p>Gouache is a fun medium. They feel similar to watercolor but they are opaque and you can add thicker layers.</p>
